- **Context-Aware Responses**: Answers questions based on your actual HR data
- **Similarity Matching**: Finds relevant information using cosine similarity

### üìä Data Management
- **Organizations Table**: Fetches company data (name, domain)
- **Employees Table**: Fetches employee data (name, email, role, phone, organization_id)
- **Real-time Updates**: Always works with latest data from Supabase

### üí¨ Interactive Chat Interface
